# Overview

This is an end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) project utilizing Google PaLM, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Langchain to create a user-friendly database querying system. The goal is to allow non-technical users, 
such as store managers in a retail clothing store, to interact with a MySQL database using natural language instead of writing complex SQL queries. This solution enables better decision-making by making data more accessible 
and understandable.

# Use Case

A retail clothing store, sells t-shirts from brands such as Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen, and Levi's. Their inventory, sales, and discount data are stored in a MySQL database. With this LLM-powered system, store managers can ask 
questions in natural language, and the system will:

1.	Convert the question into an SQL query.
	
2.	Execute the query on the MySQL database.
   
3.	Translate the results into understandable English.


## Example Queries:

•	"How many white t-shirts of a particular brand are left in stock?"

•	"How much sales revenue will be generated if all extra-small t-shirts are sold after applying discounts?"

•	"How many total t-shirts are left in stock?"

•	"How many Nike t-shirts do we have left in XS size and white color?"

•	"What is the total price of the inventory for all S-size t-shirts?"

•	"What will be the total sales amount if we sell all small-size Adidas shirts today after discounts?"


# Project Highlights & Technology Stack

•	Database: MySQL (compatible with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.)

•	LLM Model: Google PaLM

•	Embeddings: Hugging Face embeddings

•	Frontend UI: Streamlit

•	Framework: Langchain

•	Vector Store: ChromaDB

•	Advanced Techniques: Few-shot learning for improved natural language-to-SQL conversion


# Implementation Details

1. Natural Language to SQL Conversion: The system is designed to understand user queries in plain English and generate precise SQL queries. It ensures:

   •	Accurate retrieval of inventory, sales, and discount data.

   •	Logical query structuring to maintain efficiency.

   •	Seamless execution of SQL queries on the MySQL database.

3. Use of Prompt Templates: LangChain enables the use of structured prompt templates to guide the model in SQL generation and result interpretation. These templates help format responses, ensuring clarity and consistency.
   
4. Few-Shot Learning for Enhanced Query Generation: Few-shot learning improves the model’s ability to:
   
   •	Handle diverse user queries effectively.

   •	Reduce errors in SQL query generation.

   •	Adapt to variations in natural language inputs.



# How It Works

1.	User Input: The store manager asks a question in natural language.
   
2.	Query Generation: The system converts the question into a structured SQL query.
   
3.	Execution: The query runs on the MySQL database.
   
4.	Result Interpretation: The SQL results are translated into a clear, natural-language response.
   
5.	User Display: The answer is presented in an easy-to-understand format in the UI.


# Future Enhancements

•	Multi-language support for querying databases in various languages.

•	Advanced analytics using predictive AI models.

•	Support for multiple retail chains with different database structures.


# Conclusion
This project bridges the gap between natural language and structured databases, making SQL data accessible to non-technical users. By leveraging LLMs, LangChain, and NLP, store managers can retrieve valuable business insights effortlessly.
